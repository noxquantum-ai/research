NEC (Nox Entanglement Compiler) is our post-training, quantum-inspired structural compression system for pretrained language models. It uses tensor networks and related mathematical techniques to reduce the number of independent model parameters without post-compression training.

We have demonstrated aggressive structural reductions, including configuration-derived estimates of roughly 7–11×, but those representations severely degrade model capability. Preserving accuracy and functionality at substantial parameter reductions remains NEC’s central unresolved challenge.

## Latest full-model allocation run

The 2026-10-22 A40 run applied the adaptive allocator to all 32 Llama-2-7B transformer layers. It compressed 28 layers and retained four dense layers, but the resulting model failed the quality target. Ratios below are measured from serialized files, not estimated coefficient counts.

| Evaluation | Result | Notes |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Allocation | NEC 0, 4–30; FP16 dense 1–3; INT8 dense 31 | 28 NEC-compressed, 4 dense |
| Full WikiText-2 test PPL | 712.18 | 341,468 scored tokens; dense teacher 4.85948 |
| Teacher-student KL | 4.99486 nats/token | Full WikiText-2 test split |
| Next-token accuracy / teacher top-1 agreement | 12.79% / 15.59% | Same full test evaluation |
| Whole deployable package | 3.907 GB vs 13.479 GB dense; **3.45×** | Includes weights, metadata, tokenizer and loader files |
| Transformer-layer region | **3.83×** | Actual serialized allocation vs dense FP16 bytes for layers 0–31 |
| MMLU 5-shot diagnostic | 14/57 (**24.56%**) | One test question per subject; sample only, not the full benchmark |
| PPL ≤ 10 / 10× compression goal | **Failed / not met** | Allocation marked infeasible; this is not a successful quality-compression result |

The full MMLU run was stopped at 97/56,168 likelihood requests; the harness then estimated 9 h 32 min remaining, far above the requested 30-minute limit. No full MMLU score was produced. HellaSwag was not run beyond an adapter smoke check. The one-question-per-subject MMLU result is only a quick diagnostic and must not be compared as if it were the published full benchmark. The detailed report, run logs, allocation, and benchmark attempt are in [the experiment archive](results/nec_full32_adaptive_allocation_a40_20261022/README.md).
